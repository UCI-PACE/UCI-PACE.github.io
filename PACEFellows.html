									<p><b>Tyler is a 5th year PhD student in particle and astro theory. His research focuses on the significance of anomalies in physics beyond the standard model, which can serve as leading constraints on various theoretical models. In addition, he models the formation and merger rates of binary black holes, tracing their origins from galaxy formation and using the gravitational wave constraints inferred from LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. In his free time he enjoys weightlifting and is a dedicated father who loves creating memories with his daughters whether at the beach, playing games, diving into anime, etc!</p>

									<h2>Vidya Venkatesan</h2>
									<p><b>I am an Astrophysics Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine. I work with Professor Aomawa L. Shields and explore the climate and habitability of exoplanets by combining observational data with computer models. Most habitable zone studies assume a circular orbit, but ~50% of confirmed planets have eccentricity greater than 0.1. As these planets spend a significant amount of time at large distances from their host star, they may have conditions where the atmosphere falls onto the surface and forms a variety of frozen species like carbon dioxide ice and water ice. My current NASA FINESST-funded project explores how the interaction between host star spectrum and surface ice composition shapes the fraction of an eccentric planet’s year over which it can be habitable using a suite of climate models. Besides research, I am also involved in outreach with the Rising Stargirls program and collaborate on some DEI efforts with the Cal-Bridge program. My hobbies include reading/watching science fiction, running, traveling, and swing dancing.</p>

									<p><b>Hi! I'm a 3rd year grad student with a focus on condensed matter/physical chemistry. I'm a member of Zuzanna Siwy's lab, researching the effect of salt precipitation in a variety of nanopores. In my personal time, I like to dance, watch TV/movies, go camping and travel to unique places. I am always mindful on how to prioritize my own wellbeing in all facets of my life. I strongly believe that mentorship can help students reflect on their situation, having personally had many great people mentor me.</p>

									<h2>Cameron Moffett-Smith</h2>
									<p><b>I am a second year grad student in particle theory. I joined PACE because I mentored in undergrad and it was a fun and rewarding experience that I wish to continue. Additionally, mentoring is very important in fostering a healthy, supportive, and happy community, so I also wanted to help contribute to this. I am originally from LA and in my free time I like to play video games and listen to music. My favorite genre of music is rap!</p>

I love playing and watching tennis, soccer and cricket. I also enjoy rock climbing and playing softball with my fellow physicists. I joined PACE because its a great program that helps 1st year grad students adjust to grad life and gives them the tools to be succesful grad students, and I wanted to help keep it going." </p>

									<h2>Mica Bacani</h2>
									<p><b>I am a second year grad student conducting Experimental Condensed Matter research with Dr. Javier Sanchez-Yamagishi. I work with 2D materials on a nanoscopic scale (thinner than your hair), and create playgrounds in super cold temperatures and in the presence of magnetic fields for electrons to behave in crazy ways!  In my free time, I like to play videogames (have yet to complete Tears of the Kingdom and have not started Starfield), watch anime (you can find me wearing subtle anime clothes, iykyk) and k-drama, and vibe to chill music. I joined PACE because mentorship has always been important to me, as I would not be where I am without the kind and supportive mentors I have had throughout my journey. Everyone's first year of graduate school is different, and that is totally okay! We are here to help. Feel free to reach out to me or any of the other PACE mentors with any questions you may have, as we are all happy to help!</p>

									<h2>Maya Silverman</h2>
									<p><b>Maya Silverman is a Ph.D. candidate studying dark matter at the intersection of particle and astrophysics. She compares simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies to observations of the Milky Way to constrain the dark force in self-interacting dark matter. Alongside her research, Maya works as program administrator for Rising Stargirls, an astronomy outreach program geared towards middle school girls of color, and she’d love to chat about how you can get involved! Maya has experience applying to high-stakes fellowships, scholarships, and grants and mentoring students through the high-stakes writing process. In her free time, Maya enjoys playing volleyball, rock climbing, and hiking.</p>
