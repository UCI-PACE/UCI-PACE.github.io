									<h2>Tyler Smith</h2>
									<p><b>Tyler is a 4th year PhD student in particle and astro theory. His research focuses on the significance of anomalies in physics beyond the standard model, which can serve as leading constraints on various theoretical models. In addition, he models the formation and merger rates of binary black holes, tracing their origins from galaxy formation and leveraging the gravitational wave constraints inferred from LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. In his free time he enjoys weightlifting and is a dedicated father who loves creating memories with his daughters whether at the beach, playing games, diving into anime, etc!</p>

									<h2>Vidya Venkatesan</h2>
									<p><b>I am an Astrophysics Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine. I work with Professor Aomawa L. Shields and explore the climate and habitability of exoplanets by combining observational data with computer models. Most habitable zone studies assume a circular orbit, but ~50% of confirmed planets have eccentricity greater than 0.1. As these planets spend a significant amount of time at large distances from their host star, they may have conditions where the atmosphere falls onto the surface and forms a variety of frozen species like carbon dioxide ice and water ice. My current NASA FINESST-funded project explores how the interaction between host star spectrum and surface ice composition shapes the fraction of an eccentric planet’s year over which it can be habitable using a suite of climate models. Besides research, I am also involved in outreach with the Rising Stargirls program and collaborate on some DEI efforts with the Cal-Bridge program. My hobbies include reading/watching science fiction, running, traveling, and swing dancing.</p>

									<h2>India Bhalla-Ladd</h2>
									<p><b>Hi all! I'm a second-year PhD student studying particle physics. I also care a lot about the philosophy of physics and the intersection of critical theories and the philosophy of science. In my free time, I enjoy roller-blading, playing volleyball, sewing, crocheting, and baking! I joined PACE because she wants to improve the experience of first year graduate students, and increase the retention of underrepresented folk in the field. </p>

									<h2>Mica Bacani</h2>
									<p><b>I am a second year grad student conducting Experimental Condensed Matter research with Dr. Javier Sanchez-Yamagishi. I work with 2D materials on a nanoscopic scale (thinner than your hair), and create playgrounds in super cold temperatures and in the presence of magnetic fields for electrons to behave in crazy ways!  In my free time, I like to play videogames (have yet to complete Tears of the Kingdom and have not started Starfield), watch anime (you can find me wearing subtle anime clothes, iykyk) and k-drama, and vibe to chill music. I joined PACE because mentorship has always been important to me, as I would not be where I am without the kind and supportive mentors I have had throughout my journey. Everyone's first year of graduate school is different, and that is totally okay! We are here to help. Feel free to reach out to me or any of the other PACE mentors with any questions you may have, as we are all happy to help!</p>
