									<h2>Jake Rudolph</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> Hello! I started at UCI in 2023 and study applications of machine learning to theoretical particle physics. I joined PACE to pay forward the positive mentorship experiences that helped me through my first year and throughout my time in Irvine. Outside of physics I love to play sports, cook, and more importantly, eat.</p>

									<h2>Mica Bacani</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> Hello! My name is Mica. I started my PhD in 2023 and I am conducting research in experimental condensed matter physics. In particular, I study electronic transport in 2D materials. I mostly work with graphene, which is the material at the tip of your favorite number 2 pencil, but one atomic layer thick. I am interested in condensed matter since it studies the fundamental building blocks of everything around us. Mentorship has always been important to me, as I lacked mentors throughout a majority of my physics career. Having a PACE mentor during my first year of graduate school really helped me adjust and enjoy my first year. I really like the PACE program as it helps first years hear different perspectives from other graduate students in the department. In my free time, I like to watch/play basketball, play video games, listen to music, and watch anime and k-drama!</p>

									<h2>Jay Krishnan</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> Hello! I started my PhD at UCI in 2023 and am working with Kev Abazajian on cosmology and particle theory. I'm part of the PACE Leadership Team and also involve myself with teaching programs for physics undergrads. I love working out, blind solving jigsaw puzzles, audio books, and video games! </p>

									<h2>India Bhalla-Ladd</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> Hi all! I'm a second-year PhD student studying particle physics. I also care a lot about the philosophy of physics and the intersection of critical theories and the philosophy of science. In my free time, I enjoy roller-blading, playing volleyball, sewing, crocheting, and baking! I joined PACE because she wants to improve the experience of first year graduate students, and increase the retention of underrepresented folk in the field. </p>

									<h2>Tyler Smith</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> Tyler is a 4th year PhD student in particle and astro theory. His research focuses on the significance of anomalies in physics beyond the standard model, which can serve as leading constraints on various theoretical models. In addition, he models the formation and merger rates of binary black holes, tracing their origins from galaxy formation and leveraging the gravitational wave constraints inferred from LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. In his free time he enjoys weightlifting and is a dedicated father who loves creating memories with his daughters whether at the beach, playing games, diving into anime, etc! </p>

					                <h2>Ryan Rice-Smith</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> Hi, I'm a 4th year Experimental Particle Physics Ph.D. studying novel detectors to search for neutrinos, the lightest particles with mass, that are built on glaciers in places such as Antarctica and Greenland. I joined PACE to help give back to the great physics community here that supported me in my undergraduate, and now graduate work. Outside the department I run old school D&D games, host a radio show 'Elemental Exposure' on KUCI, and have recently gotten into Muay Thai. </p>

									<h2>Vidya Venkatesan (she/her)</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> I am a Ph.D. student in Astrophysics at the University of California, Irvine. I work with my co-advisors, Aomawa L. Shields (UCI) and Dr. Eric Wolf (LASP, Boulder), and explore the climate and habitability of exoplanets by combining observational data with computer models. I joined PACE to give incoming graduate students the same unwavering support I received when I joined UCI. My hobbies include reading/watching SciFi, traveling, swing/salsa dancing, and playing D&D</p>

									<h2>Eric Rumsfeld</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> PACE Leader since Fall 2024</p>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> Eric is a 2nd year PhD student in the experimental particle physics group at UCI. His research focuses on the development of novel detectors for neutrino physics, specifically the detection of neutrinos from astrophysical sources. He joined PACE to help incoming students navigate the challenges of graduate school and to foster a supportive community within the department. In his free time, Eric enjoys hiking, playing board games, and exploring new places.</p>

									<h2>Helena Garcia Escudero </h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> My name is Helena, I'm starting my 3rd year as a astroparticle graduate student at UCI. My research is in the border line between cosmology and particle physics. I was born in Spain where I did my undergrad. I love doing sport outdoors, running and spending time with my friends, doing BBQs and trying new restaurants with worldwide cuisines.</p>

									<h2>Stephanie Urbano Stawinski</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b></p>		
									<p>Stephanie is a 4th year PhD student in the experimental particle physics group at UCI. Her research focuses on the development of novel detectors for neutrino physics, specifically the detection of neutrinos from astrophysical sources. She joined PACE to help incoming students navigate the challenges of graduate school and to foster a supportive community within the department. In her free time, Stephanie enjoys hiking, playing board games, and exploring new places.</p>

									<h2>Jack Lubin</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> At UC Irvine, I am a PhD candidate where I study exoplanets primarily through the Radial Velocity detection method. In particular, I am fascinated by the problem of stellar activity induced signals, which can mask true planetary signals causing false negatives, or worse masquerade as planetary signals causing false positives. I work on the problem of stellar activity from an analysis technique approach, building new software to help us disentangle the signals in our data sets. I love being a part of PACE because I remember being a new student (I was in the first PACE cohort!) and seeing the real impact of how the program helped me through my first year and set up for success throughout my grad career. When outside the office, I enjoy hitting golf balls on the driving range and reading (and trying to write!) sci-fi short stories.</p>
