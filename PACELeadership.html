									<h2>Tyler Smith</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> Tyler is a 4th year PhD student in particle and astro theory. His research focuses on the significance of anomalies in physics beyond the standard model, which can serve as leading constraints on various theoretical models. In addition, he models the formation and merger rates of binary black holes, tracing their origins from galaxy formation and leveraging the gravitational wave constraints inferred from LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. In his free time he enjoys weightlifting and is a dedicated father who loves creating memories with his daughters whether at the beach, playing games, diving into anime, etc! </p>

					                <h2>Ryan Rice-Smith</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> Hi, I'm a 4th year Experimental Particle Physics Ph.D. studying novel detectors to search for neutrinos, the lightest particles with mass, that are built on glaciers in places such as Antarctica and Greenland. I joined PACE to help give back to the great physics community here that supported me in my undergraduate, and now graduate work. Outside the department I run old school D&D games, host a radio show 'Elemental Exposure' on KUCI, and have recently gotten into Muay Thai. </p>

									<h2>Vidya Venkatesan</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> I am an Astrophysics Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine. I work with my co-advisors, Aomawa L. Shields (UCI) and Dr. Eric Wolf (LASP, Boulder), and explore the climate and habitability of exoplanets by combining observational data with computer models. I joined PACE to give incoming graduate students the same unwavering support I received when I joined UCI. My hobbies include reading/watching SciFi, traveling, swing/salsa dancing, and playing D&D. </p>

									<h2>India Bhalla-Ladd</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> Hi all! I'm a second-year PhD student studying particle physics. I also care a lot about the philosophy of physics and the intersection of critical theories and the philosophy of science. In my free time, I enjoy roller-blading, playing volleyball, sewing, crocheting, and baking! I joined PACE because she wants to improve the experience of first year graduate students, and increase the retention of underrepresented folk in the field. </p>

									<h2>Mica Bacani</h2>
									<p><b>Leader Bio:</b> Hello! My name is Mica and I am currently a second year PhD student conducting research in experimental condensed matter physics. In particular, I study electronic transport in 2D materials. I mostly work with graphene, which is the material at the tip of your favorite number 2 pencil, but one atomic layer thick. I am interested in condensed matter since it studies the fundamental building blocks of everything around us. Mentorship has always been important to me, as I lacked mentors throughout a majority of my physics career. Having a PACE mentor during my first year of graduate school really helped me adjust and enjoy my first year. I really like the PACE program as it helps first years hear different perspectives from other graduate students in the department. In my free time, I like to watch/play basketball, play video games, listen to music, and watch anime and k-drama!</p>

									<h2>Jack Lubin</h2>
									<!--p><b>Leader Bio:</b> At UC Irvine, I am a PhD candidate where I study exoplanets primarily through the Radial Velocity detection method. In particular, I am fascinated by the problem of stellar activity induced signals, which can mask true planetary signals causing false negatives, or worse masquerade as planetary signals causing false positives. I work on the problem of stellar activity from an analysis technique approach, building new software to help us disentangle the signals in our data sets. I love being a part of PACE because I remember being a new student (I was in the first PACE cohort!) and seeing the real impact of how the program helped me through my first year and set up for success throughout my grad career. When outside the office, I enjoy hitting golf balls on the driving range and reading (and trying to write!) sci-fi short stories.</p-->
